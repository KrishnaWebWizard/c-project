#include <bits/stdc++.h>

->This line includes a set of standard libraries. It's a common practice in competitive programming but not recommended for real-world projects. Instead, you should include only the necessary headers.
using namespace std;

->This line allows you to use elements from the std namespace without prefixing them with std::. In larger projects, it's better to avoid using namespace std; and instead use explicit namespaces to prevent naming conflicts.

struct Student {
    string name;
    vector<int> grades;
};

->This defines a structure Student containing two data members: a string for the student's name and a vector of integers for their grades.

class GradeBook {
private:
    vector<Student> students;
public:
    // Member functions...
};

->This declares a class GradeBook with a private member students, which is a vector containing Student objects.
Member Functions:

->void addStudent(const string& name): Adds a new student with the given name to the grade book.
->void addGrade(const string& name, int grade): Adds a grade for the student with the given name.
->float calculateAverage(const string& name): Calculates the average grade for the student with the given name.
->void generateReport(): Generates a report displaying each student's name and their average grade.

int main() {
    // GradeBook object creation
    GradeBook gradebook;

    // Adding students
    gradebook.addStudent("John");
    gradebook.addStudent("Alice");

    // Adding grades
    gradebook.addGrade("John", 85);
    gradebook.addGrade("John", 90);
    gradebook.addGrade("Alice", 75);
    gradebook.addGrade("Alice", 80);

    // Generating report
    gradebook.generateReport();

    return 0;
}

-> An instance of GradeBook named gradebook is created.

->Two students ("John" and "Alice") are added using addStudent().

->Grades are added for each student using addGrade().

->Finally, generateReport() is called to display the report.

           Student Report:
           Name           Average
         -------------------------
           John           87.50
           Alice          77.50

->The output shows the report with each student's name and their average grade.

To integrate this code into a real-world scenario, you may want to consider the following improvements:

->Error handling: Add more robust error handling, such as checking for invalid inputs or handling edge cases.

->Data storage: Implement a more efficient data storage mechanism, such as using a database instead of storing data in memory.

->User interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the grade book system, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web application.

->Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.

->Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of students and grades efficiently.

->Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.

       |*These improvements will make the code more suitable for use in a real-world application.*|
